## How to Use This Guide

1. Start from Part 0 and work your way through sequentially
2. Complete the practical exercises to reinforce your learning
3. Use the reference materials when you need to refresh specific concepts
4. Remember that understanding the concepts is more important than memorizing commands

## Learning Philosophy

These materials are designed not just to teach you Git commands, but to create situations where you'll naturally want to use Git. Through these experiences, Git will transform from an external tool into a natural capabilityâ€”something you reach for instinctively because you understand its value firsthand.
